			The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected
			computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)
			to communicate between networks and devices.
			It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic,
			business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of
			electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of
			information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and
			applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

			The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and
			research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable t
			ime-sharing of computers.[1] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET,
			initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s.
